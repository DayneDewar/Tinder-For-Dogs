# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# accounts = [
#   {email: "dayne@example.com", first_name: "Dayne", dog_name: "Sora", username: "dayne1", password: "Password1"},
#   {email: "chris@example.com", first_name: "Chris", dog_name: "Stormi", username: "chris1", password: "Password1"},
#   {email: "andrea@example.com", first_name: "Andrea", dog_name: "Kona", username: "andrea1", password: "Password1"},
# ]

# accounts.each do |acc|
#     Account.create(acc)
